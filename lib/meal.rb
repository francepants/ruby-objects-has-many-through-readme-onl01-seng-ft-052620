#setting up our `Meal` class as a 'joining' model between our `Waiter` and our `Customer` classes. And because we're obeying the `single source of truth`, we're going to tell the `Meal` class to know all the details of each `meal` instance. That includes not only the total cost and the tip (which defaults to 0) but also who the `customer` and `waiter` were for each meal.
